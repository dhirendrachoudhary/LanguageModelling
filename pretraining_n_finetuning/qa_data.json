    "context": "To Your Good Health!\n\nLong, long ago there lived a king who was such a mighty monarch that\nwhenever he sneezed every one in the whole country had to say 'To your\ngood health!' Every one said it except the shepherd with the staring\neyes, and he would not say it.\n\nThe king heard of this and was very angry, and sent for the shepherd to\nappear before him.\n\nThe shepherd came and stood before the throne, where the king sat\nlooking very grand and powerful. But however grand or powerful he might\nbe the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.\n\n'Say at once, \"To my good health!\"' cried the king.\n\n'To my good health!' replied the shepherd.\n\n'To mine--to mine, you rascal, you vagabond!' stormed the king.\n\n'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer.\n\n'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a\nrage.\n\n'Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own,' cried the shepherd, and\ngently tapped his breast.\n\nThe king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do, when\nthe Lord Chamberlain interfered:\n\n'Say at once--say this very moment: \"To your health, your Majesty\"; for\nif you don't say it you'll lose your life, whispered he.\n\n'No, I won't say it till I get the princess for my wife,' was the\nshepherd's answer. Now the princess was sitting on a little throne\nbeside the king, her father, and she looked as sweet and lovely as a\nlittle golden dove. When she heard what the shepherd said she could not\nhelp laughing, for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd\nwith the staring eyes pleased her very much; indeed he pleased her\nbetter than any king's son she had yet seen.\n\nBut the king was not as pleasant as his daughter, and he gave orders to\nthrow the shepherd into the white bear's pit.\n\nThe guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear,\nwho had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry. The door of\nthe pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd; but when\nit saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself. It\nshrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there, and, in spite of\nbeing so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked its own paws\nfrom sheer hunger. The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes\noff the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep himself awake he\nmade songs and sang them, and so the night went by.\n\nNext morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd's bones, and\nwas amazed to find him alive and well. He led him to the king, who fell\ninto a furious passion, and said: 'Well, you have learned what it is to\nbe very near death, and now will you say \"To my good health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd answered: 'I am not afraid of ten deaths! I will only\nsay it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to your death,' cried the king; and ordered him to be thrown\ninto the den with the wild boars. The wild boars had not been fed for a\nweek, and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him\nto tear him to pieces. But the shepherd took a little flute out of the\nsleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune, on which the wild\nboars first of all shrank shyly away, and then got up on their hind legs\nand danced gaily. The shepherd would have given anything to be able to\nlaugh, they looked so funny; but he dared not stop playing, for he knew\nwell enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear\nhim to pieces. His eyes were of no use to him here, for he could not\nhave stared ten wild boars in the face at once; so he kept on playing,\nand the wild boars danced very slowly, as if in a minuet, then by\ndegrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and\nturn quickly enough, and ended by all falling over each other in a heap,\nquite exhausted and out of breath.\n\nThen the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long\nand so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning,\nexpecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his\ncheeks from laughter.\n\nAs soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before\nhim; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not\ntorn the man to bits, and he said: 'Well, you have learned what it feels\nto be near ten deaths, now say \"To my good health!\"'\n\nBut the shepherd broke in with, 'I do not fear a hundred deaths, and I\nwill only say it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to a hundred deaths!' roared the king, and ordered the shepherd\nto be thrown down the deep vault of scythes.\n\nThe guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of which\nwas a deep well with sharp scythes all round it. At the bottom of the\nwell was a little light by which one could see if anyone was thrown in\nwhether he had fallen to the bottom.\n\nWhen the shepherd was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards to\nleave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of\nscythes; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say 'To your\ngood health' to the king. So the guards left him alone and he stuck up\nhis long stick near the well, hung his cloak round the stick and put his\nhat on the top. He also hung his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it\nmight seem to have some body within it. When this was done he called out\nto the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all\nhe could not make up his mind to say what the king wished. The guards\ncame in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all down the well\ntogether, watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and\ncame away, thinking that now there really was an end of the shepherd.\nBut he had hidden in a dark corner and was laughing to himself all the\ntime.\n\nQuite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain, carrying a lamp and\nhe nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the shepherd alive\nand well. He brought him to the king, whose fury was greater than ever,\nbut who cried:\n\n'Well, now you have been near a hundred deaths; will you say: \"To your\ngood health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd only gave the same answer:\n\n'I won't say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\n'Perhaps after all you may do it for less,' said the king, who saw that\nthere was no chance of making away with the shepherd; and he ordered the\nstate coach to be got ready, then he made the shepherd get in with him\nand sit beside him, and ordered the coachman to drive to the silver\nwood. When they reached it he said: 'Do you see this silver wood? Well,\nif you will say, \"To your good health,\" I will give it to you.'\n\nThe shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:\n\n'I will not say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\nThe king was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a\nsplendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:\n\n'Do you see this golden castle? Well, I will give you that too, the\nsilver wood and the golden castle, if only you will say that one thing\nto me: \"To your good health.\"'\n\nThe shepherd gaped and wondered and was quite dazzled, but he still\nsaid:\n\n'No; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThis time the king was overwhelmed with grief, and gave orders to drive\non to the diamond pond, and there he tried once more.\n\n'Do you see this diamond pond? I will give you that too, the silver\nwood and the golden castle and the diamond pond. You shall have them\nall--all--if you will but say: \"To your good health!\"'\n\nThe shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled with\nthe brilliant pond, but still he said:\n\n'No, no; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThen the king saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he might\nas well give in, so he said:\n\n'Well, well, it's all the same to me--I will give you my daughter to\nwife; but, then, you really and truly must say to me: \"To your good\nhealth.\"'\n\n'Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it? It stands to reason\nthat I shall say it then.'\n\nAt this the king was more delighted than anyone could have believed.\nHe made it known all through the country that there were to be great\nrejoicings, as the princess was going to be married. And everyone\nrejoiced to think that the princess, who had refused so many royal\nsuitors, should have ended by falling in love with the staring-eyed\nshepherd.\n\nThere was such a wedding as had never been seen. Everyone ate and drank\nand danced. Even the sick were feasted, and quite tiny new-born children\nhad presents given them.\n\nBut the greatest merry-making was in the king's palace; there the best\nbands played and the best food was cooked; a crowd of people sat down to\ntable, and all was fun and merry-making.\n\nAnd when the groomsman, according to custom, brought in the great boar's\nhead on a big dish and placed it before the king so that he might carve\nit and give everyone a share, the savoury smell was so strong that the\nking began to sneeze with all his might.\n\n'To your very good health,' cried the shepherd before anyone else, and\nthe king was so delighted that he did not regret having given him his\ndaughter.\n\nIn time, when the old king died, the shepherd succeeded him. He made a\nvery good king and never expected his people to wish him well against\ntheir wills; but, all the same, everyone did wish him well, for they all\nloved him.\n",
    "question": "Why did everyone in the kingdom say 'To your good health!' when the king sneezed?",
    "answer": "Because it was a royal order, and everyone in the kingdom had to say it whenever the king sneezed."

But however grand or powerful he might\nbe the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.\n\n'Say at once, \"To my good health!\"' cried the king.\n\n'To my good health!' replied the shepherd.\n\n'To mine--to mine, you rascal, you vagabond!' stormed the king.\n\n'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer.\n\n'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a\nrage.\n\n'Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own,' cried the shepherd, and\ngently tapped his breast.\n\nThe king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do, when\nthe Lord Chamberlain interfered:\n\n'Say at once--say this very moment: \"To your health, your Majesty\"; for\nif you don't say it you'll lose your life, whispered he.\n\n'No, I won't say it till I get the princess for my wife,' was the\nshepherd's answer. Now the princess was sitting on a little throne\nbeside the king, her father, and she looked as sweet and lovely as a\nlittle golden dove. When she heard what the shepherd said she could not\nhelp laughing, for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd\nwith the staring eyes pleased her very much; indeed he pleased her\nbetter than any king's son she had yet seen.\n\nBut the king was not as pleasant as his daughter, and he gave orders to\nthrow the shepherd into the white bear's pit.\n\nThe guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear,\nwho had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry. The door of\nthe pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd; but when\nit saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself. It\nshrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there, and, in spite of\nbeing so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked its own paws\nfrom sheer hunger. The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes\noff the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep himself awake he\nmade songs and sang them, and so the night went by.\n\nNext morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd's bones, and\nwas amazed to find him alive and well. He led him to the king, who fell\ninto a furious passion, and said: 'Well, you have learned what it is to\nbe very near death, and now will you say \"To my good health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd answered: 'I am not afraid of ten deaths! I will only\nsay it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to your death,' cried the king; and ordered him to be thrown\ninto the den with the wild boars. The wild boars had not been fed for a\nweek, and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him\nto tear him to pieces. But the shepherd took a little flute out of the\nsleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune, on which the wild\nboars first of all shrank shyly away, and then got up on their hind legs\nand danced gaily. The shepherd would have given anything to be able to\nlaugh, they looked so funny; but he dared not stop playing, for he knew\nwell enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear\nhim to pieces. His eyes were of no use to him here, for he could not\nhave stared ten wild boars in the face at once; so he kept on playing,\nand the wild boars danced very slowly, as if in a minuet, then by\ndegrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and\nturn quickly enough, and ended by all falling over each other in a heap,\nquite exhausted and out of breath.\n\nThen the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long\nand so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning,\nexpecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his\ncheeks from laughter.\n\nAs soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before\nhim; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not\ntorn the man to bits, and he said: 'Well, you have learned what it feels\nto be near ten deaths, now say \"To my good health!\"'\n\nBut the shepherd broke in with, 'I do not fear a hundred deaths, and I\nwill only say it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to a hundred deaths!' roared the king, and ordered the shepherd\nto be thrown down the deep vault of scythes.\n\nThe guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of which\nwas a deep well with sharp scythes all round it. At the bottom of the\nwell was a little light by which one could see if anyone was thrown in\nwhether he had fallen to the bottom.\n\nWhen the shepherd was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards to\nleave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of\nscythes; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say 'To your\ngood health' to the king. So the guards left him alone and he stuck up\nhis long stick near the well, hung his cloak round the stick and put his\nhat on the top. He also hung his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it\nmight seem to have some body within it. When this was done he called out\nto the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all\nhe could not make up his mind to say what the king wished. The guards\ncame in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all down the well\ntogether, watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and\ncame away, thinking that now there really was an end of the shepherd.\nBut he had hidden in a dark corner and was laughing to himself all the\ntime.\n\nQuite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain, carrying a lamp and\nhe nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the shepherd alive\nand well. He brought him to the king, whose fury was greater than ever,\nbut who cried:\n\n'Well, now you have been near a hundred deaths; will you say: \"To your\ngood health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd only gave the same answer:\n\n'I won't say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\n'Perhaps after all you may do it for less,' said the king, who saw that\nthere was no chance of making away with the shepherd; and he ordered the\nstate coach to be got ready, then he made the shepherd get in with him\nand sit beside him, and ordered the coachman to drive to the silver\nwood. When they reached it he said: 'Do you see this silver wood? Well,\nif you will say, \"To your good health,\" I will give it to you.'\n\nThe shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:\n\n'I will not say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\nThe king was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a\nsplendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:\n\n'Do you see this golden castle? Well, I will give you that too, the\nsilver wood and the golden castle, if only you will say that one thing\nto me: \"To your good health.\"'\n\nThe shepherd gaped and wondered and was quite dazzled, but he still\nsaid:\n\n'No; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThis time the king was overwhelmed with grief, and gave orders to drive\non to the diamond pond, and there he tried once more.\n\n'Do you see this diamond pond? I will give you that too, the silver\nwood and the golden castle and the diamond pond. You shall have them\nall--all--if you will but say: \"To your good health!\"'\n\nThe shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled with\nthe brilliant pond, but still he said:\n\n'No, no; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThen the king saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he might\nas well give in, so he said:\n\n'Well, well, it's all the same to me--I will give you my daughter to\nwife; but, then, you really and truly must say to me: \"To your good\nhealth.\"'\n\n'Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it? It stands to reason\nthat I shall say it then.'\n\nAt this the king was more delighted than anyone could have believed.\nHe made it known all through the country that there were to be great\nrejoicings, as the princess was going to be married. And everyone\nrejoiced to think that the princess, who had refused so many royal\nsuitors, should have ended by falling in love with the staring-eyed\nshepherd.\n\nThere was such a wedding as had never been seen. Everyone ate and drank\nand danced. Even the sick were feasted, and quite tiny new-born children\nhad presents given them.\n\nBut the greatest merry-making was in the king's palace; there the best\nbands played and the best food was cooked; a crowd of people sat down to\ntable, and all was fun and merry-making.\n\nAnd when the groomsman, according to custom, brought in the great boar's\nhead on a big dish and placed it before the king so that he might carve\nit and give everyone a share, the savoury smell was so strong that the\nking began to sneeze with all his might.\n\n'To your very good health,' cried the shepherd before anyone else, and\nthe king was so delighted that he did not regret having given him his\ndaughter.\n\nIn time, when the old king died, the shepherd succeeded him.

But however grand or powerful he might\nbe the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.\n\n'Say at once, \"To my good health!\"' cried the king.\n\n'To my good health!' replied the shepherd.\n\n'To mine--to mine, you rascal, you vagabond!' stormed the king.\n\n'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer.\n\n'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a\nrage.\n\n'Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own,' cried the shepherd, and\ngently tapped his breast.\n\nThe king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do, when\nthe Lord Chamberlain interfered:\n\n'Say at once--say this very moment: \"To your health, your Majesty\"; for\nif you don't say it you'll lose your life, whispered he.\n\n'No, I won't say it till I get the princess for my wife,' was the\nshepherd's answer. Now the princess was sitting on a little throne\nbeside the king, her father, and she looked as sweet and lovely as a\nlittle golden dove. When she heard what the shepherd said she could not\nhelp laughing, for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd\nwith the staring eyes pleased her very much; indeed he pleased her\nbetter than any king's son she had yet seen.\n\nBut the king was not as pleasant as his daughter, and he gave orders to\nthrow the shepherd into the white bear's pit.\n\nThe guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear,\nwho had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry. The door of\nthe pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd; but when\nit saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself. It\nshrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there, and, in spite of\nbeing so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked its own paws\nfrom sheer hunger. The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes\noff the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep himself awake he\nmade songs and sang them, and so the night went by.\n\nNext morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd's bones, and\nwas amazed to find him alive and well. He led him to the king, who fell\ninto a furious passion, and said: 'Well, you have learned what it is to\nbe very near death, and now will you say \"To my good health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd answered: 'I am not afraid of ten deaths! I will only\nsay it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to your death,' cried the king; and ordered him to be thrown\ninto the den with the wild boars. The wild boars had not been fed for a\nweek, and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him\nto tear him to pieces. But the shepherd took a little flute out of the\nsleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune, on which the wild\nboars first of all shrank shyly away, and then got up on their hind legs\nand danced gaily. The shepherd would have given anything to be able to\nlaugh, they looked so funny; but he dared not stop playing, for he knew\nwell enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear\nhim to pieces. His eyes were of no use to him here, for he could not\nhave stared ten wild boars in the face at once; so he kept on playing,\nand the wild boars danced very slowly, as if in a minuet, then by\ndegrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and\nturn quickly enough, and ended by all falling over each other in a heap,\nquite exhausted and out of breath.\n\nThen the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long\nand so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning,\nexpecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his\ncheeks from laughter.\n\nAs soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before\nhim; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not\ntorn the man to bits, and he said: 'Well, you have learned what it feels\nto be near ten deaths, now say \"To my good health!\"'\n\nBut the shepherd broke in with, 'I do not fear a hundred deaths, and I\nwill only say it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to a hundred deaths!' roared the king, and ordered the shepherd\nto be thrown down the deep vault of scythes.\n\nThe guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of which\nwas a deep well with sharp scythes all round it. At the bottom of the\nwell was a little light by which one could see if anyone was thrown in\nwhether he had fallen to the bottom.\n\nWhen the shepherd was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards to\nleave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of\nscythes; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say 'To your\ngood health' to the king. So the guards left him alone and he stuck up\nhis long stick near the well, hung his cloak round the stick and put his\nhat on the top. He also hung his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it\nmight seem to have some body within it. When this was done he called out\nto the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all\nhe could not make up his mind to say what the king wished. The guards\ncame in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all down the well\ntogether, watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and\ncame away, thinking that now there really was an end of the shepherd.\nBut he had hidden in a dark corner and was laughing to himself all the\ntime.\n\nQuite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain, carrying a lamp and\nhe nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the shepherd alive\nand well. He brought him to the king, whose fury was greater than ever,\nbut who cried:\n\n'Well, now you have been near a hundred deaths; will you say: \"To your\ngood health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd only gave the same answer:\n\n'I won't say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\n'Perhaps after all you may do it for less,' said the king, who saw that\nthere was no chance of making away with the shepherd; and he ordered the\nstate coach to be got ready, then he made the shepherd get in with him\nand sit beside him, and ordered the coachman to drive to the silver\nwood. When they reached it he said: 'Do you see this silver wood? Well,\nif you will say, \"To your good health,\" I will give it to you.'\n\nThe shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:\n\n'I will not say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\nThe king was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a\nsplendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:\n\n'Do you see this golden castle? Well, I will give you that too, the\nsilver wood and the golden castle, if only you will say that one thing\nto me: \"To your good health.\"'\n\nThe shepherd gaped and wondered and was quite dazzled, but he still\nsaid:\n\n'No; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThis time the king was overwhelmed with grief, and gave orders to drive\non to the diamond pond, and there he tried once more.\n\n'Do you see this diamond pond? I will give you that too, the silver\nwood and the golden castle and the diamond pond. You shall have them\nall--all--if you will but say: \"To your good health!\"'\n\nThe shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled with\nthe brilliant pond, but still he said:\n\n'No, no; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThen the king saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he might\nas well give in, so he said:\n\n'Well, well, it's all the same to me--I will give you my daughter to\nwife; but, then, you really and truly must say to me: \"To your good\nhealth.\"'\n\n'Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it? It stands to reason\nthat I shall say it then.'\n\nAt this the king was more delighted than anyone could have believed.\nHe made it known all through the country that there were to be great\nrejoicings, as the princess was going to be married. And everyone\nrejoiced to think that the princess, who had refused so many royal\nsuitors, should have ended by falling in love with the staring-eyed\nshepherd.\n\nThere was such a wedding as had never been seen. Everyone ate and drank\nand danced. Even the sick were feasted, and quite tiny new-born children\nhad presents given them.\n\nBut the greatest merry-making was in the king's palace; there the best\nbands played and the best food was cooked; a crowd of people sat down to\ntable, and all was fun and merry-making.\n\nAnd when the groomsman, according to custom, brought in the great boar's\nhead on a big dish and placed it before the king so that he might carve\nit and give everyone a share, the savoury smell was so strong that the\nking began to sneeze with all his might.\n\n'To your very good health,' cried the shepherd before anyone else, and\nthe king was so delighted that he did not regret having given him his\ndaughter.\n\nIn time, when the old king died, the shepherd succeeded him.

But however grand or powerful he might\nbe the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.\n\n'Say at once, \"To my good health!\"' cried the king.\n\n'To my good health!' replied the shepherd.\n\n'To mine--to mine, you rascal, you vagabond!' stormed the king.\n\n'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer.\n\n'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a\nrage.\n\n'Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own,' cried the shepherd, and\ngently tapped his breast.\n\nThe king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do, when\nthe Lord Chamberlain interfered:\n\n'Say at once--say this very moment: \"To your health, your Majesty\"; for\nif you don't say it you'll lose your life, whispered he.\n\n'No, I won't say it till I get the princess for my wife,' was the\nshepherd's answer. Now the princess was sitting on a little throne\nbeside the king, her father, and she looked as sweet and lovely as a\nlittle golden dove. When she heard what the shepherd said she could not\nhelp laughing, for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd\nwith the staring eyes pleased her very much; indeed he pleased her\nbetter than any king's son she had yet seen.\n\nBut the king was not as pleasant as his daughter, and he gave orders to\nthrow the shepherd into the white bear's pit.\n\nThe guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear,\nwho had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry. The door of\nthe pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd; but when\nit saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself. It\nshrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there, and, in spite of\nbeing so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked its own paws\nfrom sheer hunger. The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes\noff the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep himself awake he\nmade songs and sang them, and so the night went by.\n\nNext morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd's bones, and\nwas amazed to find him alive and well. He led him to the king, who fell\ninto a furious passion, and said: 'Well, you have learned what it is to\nbe very near death, and now will you say \"To my good health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd answered: 'I am not afraid of ten deaths! I will only\nsay it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to your death,' cried the king; and ordered him to be thrown\ninto the den with the wild boars. The wild boars had not been fed for a\nweek, and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him\nto tear him to pieces. But the shepherd took a little flute out of the\nsleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune, on which the wild\nboars first of all shrank shyly away, and then got up on their hind legs\nand danced gaily. The shepherd would have given anything to be able to\nlaugh, they looked so funny; but he dared not stop playing, for he knew\nwell enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear\nhim to pieces. His eyes were of no use to him here, for he could not\nhave stared ten wild boars in the face at once; so he kept on playing,\nand the wild boars danced very slowly, as if in a minuet, then by\ndegrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and\nturn quickly enough, and ended by all falling over each other in a heap,\nquite exhausted and out of breath.\n\nThen the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long\nand so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning,\nexpecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his\ncheeks from laughter.\n\nAs soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before\nhim; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not\ntorn the man to bits, and he said: 'Well, you have learned what it feels\nto be near ten deaths, now say \"To my good health!\"'\n\nBut the shepherd broke in with, 'I do not fear a hundred deaths, and I\nwill only say it if I may have the princess for my wife.'\n\n'Then go to a hundred deaths!' roared the king, and ordered the shepherd\nto be thrown down the deep vault of scythes.\n\nThe guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of which\nwas a deep well with sharp scythes all round it. At the bottom of the\nwell was a little light by which one could see if anyone was thrown in\nwhether he had fallen to the bottom.\n\nWhen the shepherd was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards to\nleave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of\nscythes; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say 'To your\ngood health' to the king. So the guards left him alone and he stuck up\nhis long stick near the well, hung his cloak round the stick and put his\nhat on the top. He also hung his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it\nmight seem to have some body within it. When this was done he called out\nto the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all\nhe could not make up his mind to say what the king wished. The guards\ncame in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all down the well\ntogether, watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and\ncame away, thinking that now there really was an end of the shepherd.\nBut he had hidden in a dark corner and was laughing to himself all the\ntime.\n\nQuite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain, carrying a lamp and\nhe nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the shepherd alive\nand well. He brought him to the king, whose fury was greater than ever,\nbut who cried:\n\n'Well, now you have been near a hundred deaths; will you say: \"To your\ngood health\"?'\n\nBut the shepherd only gave the same answer:\n\n'I won't say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\n'Perhaps after all you may do it for less,' said the king, who saw that\nthere was no chance of making away with the shepherd; and he ordered the\nstate coach to be got ready, then he made the shepherd get in with him\nand sit beside him, and ordered the coachman to drive to the silver\nwood. When they reached it he said: 'Do you see this silver wood? Well,\nif you will say, \"To your good health,\" I will give it to you.'\n\nThe shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:\n\n'I will not say it till the princess is my wife.'\n\nThe king was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a\nsplendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:\n\n'Do you see this golden castle? Well, I will give you that too, the\nsilver wood and the golden castle, if only you will say that one thing\nto me: \"To your good health.\"'\n\nThe shepherd gaped and wondered and was quite dazzled, but he still\nsaid:\n\n'No; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThis time the king was overwhelmed with grief, and gave orders to drive\non to the diamond pond, and there he tried once more.\n\n'Do you see this diamond pond? I will give you that too, the silver\nwood and the golden castle and the diamond pond. You shall have them\nall--all--if you will but say: \"To your good health!\"'\n\nThe shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled with\nthe brilliant pond, but still he said:\n\n'No, no; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\n\nThen the king saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he might\nas well give in, so he said:\n\n'Well, well, it's all the same to me--I will give you my daughter to\nwife; but, then, you really and truly must say to me: \"To your good\nhealth.\"'\n\n'Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it? It stands to reason\nthat I shall say it then.'\n\nAt this the king was more delighted than anyone could have believed.\nHe made it known all through the country that there were to be great\nrejoicings, as the princess was going to be married. And everyone\nrejoiced to think that the princess, who had refused so many royal\nsuitors, should have ended by falling in love with the staring-eyed\nshepherd.\n\nThere was such a wedding as had never been seen. Everyone ate and drank\nand danced. Even the sick were feasted, and quite tiny new-born children\nhad presents given them.\n\nBut the greatest merry-making was in the king's palace; there the best\nbands played and the best food was cooked; a crowd of people sat down to\ntable, and all was fun and merry-making.\n\nAnd when the groomsman, according to custom, brought in the great boar's\nhead on a big dish and placed it before the king so that he might carve\nit and give everyone a share, the savoury smell was so strong that the\nking began to sneeze with all his might.\n\n'To your very good health,' cried the shepherd before anyone else, and\nthe king was so delighted that he did not regret having given him his\ndaughter.\n\nIn time, when the old king died, the shepherd succeeded him. He made a\nvery good king and never expected his people to wish him well against\ntheir wills; but, all the same, everyone did wish him well, for they all\nloved him.\n",
    "question": "What kind of king did the shepherd become?",
    "answer": "A beloved king who never forced his people to wish him well and ruled justly."

    "context": "Lovely Ilonka\nThere was once a king's son who told his father that he wished to marry.\n\n'No, no!' said the king; 'you must not be in such a hurry. Wait till you\nhave done some great deed. My father did not let me marry till I had won\nthe golden sword you see me wear.'\n\nThe prince was much disappointed, but he never dreamed of disobeying his\nfather, and he began to think with all his might what he could do. It\nwas no use staying at home, so one day he wandered out into the world to\ntry his luck, and as he walked along he came to a little hut in which he\nfound an old woman crouching over the fire.\n\n'Good evening, mother. I see you have lived long in this world; do you\nknow anything about the three bulrushes?'\n\n'Yes, indeed, I've lived long and been much about in the world, but I\nhave never seen or heard anything of what you ask. Still, if you will\nwait till to-morrow I may be able to tell you something.'\n\nWell, he waited till the morning, and quite early the old woman appeared\nand took out a little pipe and blew in it, and in a moment all the crows\nin the world were flying about her. Not one was missing. Then she asked\nif they knew anything about the three bulrushes, but not one of them\ndid.\n\nThe prince went on his way, and a little further on he found another hut\nin which lived an old man. On being questioned the old man said he knew\nnothing, but begged the prince to stay overnight, and the next morning\nthe old man called all the ravens together, but they too had nothing to\ntell.\n\nThe prince bade him farewell and set out. He wandered so far that he\ncrossed seven kingdoms, and at last, one evening, he came to a little\nhouse in which was an old woman.\n\n'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely.\n\n'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman. 'It is\nlucky for you that you spoke to me or you would have met with a horrible\ndeath. But may I ask where are you going?'\n\n'I am seeking the three bulrushes. Do you know anything about them?'\n\n'I don't know anything myself, but wait till to-morrow. Perhaps I can\ntell you then.' So the next morning she blew on her pipe, and lo!\nand behold every magpie in the world flew up. That is to say, all the\nmagpies except one who had broken a leg and a wing. The old woman sent\nafter it at once, and when she questioned the magpies the crippled one\nwas the only one who knew where the three bulrushes were.\n\nThen the prince started off with the lame magpie. They went on and on\ntill they reached a great stone wall, many, many feet high.\n\n'Now, prince,' said the magpie, 'the three bulrushes are behind that\nwall.'\n\nThe prince wasted no time. He set his horse at the wall and leaped over\nit. Then he looked about for the three bulrushes, pulled them up and\nset off with them on his way home. As he rode along one of the bulrushes\nhappened to knock against something. It split open and, only think! out\nsprang a lovely girl, who said: 'My heart's love, you are mine and I am\nyours; do give me a glass of water.'\n\nBut how could the prince give it her when there was no water at hand?\nSo the lovely maiden flew away. He split the second bulrush as an\nexperiment and just the same thing happened.\n\nHow careful he was of the third bulrush! He waited till he came to a\nwell, and there he split it open, and out sprang a maiden seven times\nlovelier than either of the others, and she too said: 'My heart's love,\nI am yours and you are mine; do give me a glass of water.'\n\nThis time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away, but she\nand the prince promised to love each other always. Then they set out for\nhome.\n\nThey soon reached the prince's country, and as he wished to bring his\npromised bride back in a fine coach he went on to the town to fetch one.\nIn the field where the well was, the king's swineherds and cowherds were\nfeeding their droves, and the prince left Ilonka (for that was her name)\nin their care.\n\nUnluckily the chief swineherd had an ugly old daughter, and whilst the\nprince was away he dressed her up in fine clothes, and threw Ilonka into\nthe well.\n\nThe prince returned before long, bringing with him his father and mother\nand a great train of courtiers to escort Ilonka home. But how they all\nstared when they saw the swineherd's ugly daughter! However, there was\nnothing for it but to take her home; and, two days later, the prince\nmarried her, and his father gave up the crown to him.\n\nBut he had no peace! He knew very well he had been cheated, though he\ncould not think how. Once he desired to have some water brought him from\nthe well into which Ilonka had been thrown. The coachman went for it\nand, in the bucket he pulled up, a pretty little duck was swimming.\nHe looked wonderingly at it, and all of a sudden it disappeared and he\nfound a dirty looking girl standing near him. The girl returned with him\nand managed to get a place as housemaid in the palace.\n\nOf course she was very busy all day long, but whenever she had a little\nspare time she sat down to spin. Her distaff turned of itself and her\nspindle span by itself and the flax wound itself off; and however much\nshe might use there was always plenty left.\n\nWhen the queen--or, rather, the swineherd's daughter--heard of this,\nshe very much wished to have the distaff, but the girl flatly refused\nto give it to her. However, at last she consented on condition that she\nmight sleep one night in the king's room. The queen was very angry, and\nscolded her well; but as she longed to have the distaff she consented,\nthough she gave the king a sleeping draught at supper.\n\nThen the girl went to the king's room looking seven times lovelier than\never. She bent over the sleeper and said: 'My heart's love, I am yours\nand you are mine. Speak to me but once; I am your Ilonka.' But the king\nwas so sound asleep he neither heard nor spoke, and Ilonka left the\nroom, sadly thinking he was ashamed to own her.\n\nSoon after the queen again sent to say that she wanted to buy the\nspindle. The girl agreed to let her have it on the same conditions as\nbefore; but this time, also, the queen took care to give the king a\nsleeping draught. And once more Ilonka went to the king's room and spoke\nto him; whisper as sweetly as she might she could get no answer.\n\nNow some of the king's servants had taken note of the matter, and warned\ntheir master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him,\nas for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught. The\nqueen had no idea that her doings had been discovered; and when, a few\ndays later, she wanted the flax, and had to pay the same price for it,\nshe felt no fears at all.\n\nAt supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things\nto eat and drink, but he declared he was not hungry, and went early to\nbed.\n\nThe queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl, but it was too late\nto recall it; for Ilonka had already entered the king's room, where he\nlay anxiously waiting for something, he knew not what. All of a sudden\nhe saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said: 'My dearest love, I\nam yours and you are mine. Speak to me, for I am your Ilonka.'\n\nAt these words the king's heart bounded within him. He sprang up and\nembraced and kissed her, and she told him all her adventures since the\nmoment he had left her. And when he heard all that Ilonka had suffered,\nand how he had been deceived, he vowed he would be revenged; so he gave\norders that the swineherd, his wife and daughter should all be hanged;\nand so they were.\n\nThe next day the king was married, with great rejoicings, to the fair\nIlonka; and if they are not yet dead--why, they are still living.\n\n\n",
    "question": "Why did the prince decide to leave home and travel the world?",
    "answer": "The prince decided to leave home and travel the world because his father told him that he could not marry until he had done some great deed. The prince wanted to fulfill this requirement and find the three bulrushes."

    "context": "Lovely Ilonka\nThere was once a king's son who told his father that he wished to marry.\n\n'No, no!' said the king; 'you must not be in such a hurry. Wait till you\nhave done some great deed. My father did not let me marry till I had won\nthe golden sword you see me wear.'\n\nThe prince was much disappointed, but he never dreamed of disobeying his\nfather, and he began to think with all his might what he could do. It\nwas no use staying at home, so one day he wandered out into the world to\ntry his luck, and as he walked along he came to a little hut in which he\nfound an old woman crouching over the fire.\n\n'Good evening, mother. I see you have lived long in this world; do you\nknow anything about the three bulrushes?'\n\n'Yes, indeed, I've lived long and been much about in the world, but I\nhave never seen or heard anything of what you ask. Still, if you will\nwait till to-morrow I may be able to tell you something.'\n\nWell, he waited till the morning, and quite early the old woman appeared\nand took out a little pipe and blew in it, and in a moment all the crows\nin the world were flying about her. Not one was missing. Then she asked\nif they knew anything about the three bulrushes, but not one of them\ndid.\n\nThe prince went on his way, and a little further on he found another hut\nin which lived an old man. On being questioned the old man said he knew\nnothing, but begged the prince to stay overnight, and the next morning\nthe old man called all the ravens together, but they too had nothing to\ntell.\n\nThe prince bade him farewell and set out. He wandered so far that he\ncrossed seven kingdoms, and at last, one evening, he came to a little\nhouse in which was an old woman.\n\n'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely.\n\n'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman. 'It is\nlucky for you that you spoke to me or you would have met with a horrible\ndeath. But may I ask where are you going?'\n\n'I am seeking the three bulrushes. Do you know anything about them?'\n\n'I don't know anything myself, but wait till to-morrow. Perhaps I can\ntell you then.' So the next morning she blew on her pipe, and lo!\nand behold every magpie in the world flew up. That is to say, all the\nmagpies except one who had broken a leg and a wing. The old woman sent\nafter it at once, and when she questioned the magpies the crippled one\nwas the only one who knew where the three bulrushes were.\n\nThen the prince started off with the lame magpie. They went on and on\ntill they reached a great stone wall, many, many feet high.\n\n'Now, prince,' said the magpie, 'the three bulrushes are behind that\nwall.'\n\nThe prince wasted no time. He set his horse at the wall and leaped over\nit. Then he looked about for the three bulrushes, pulled them up and\nset off with them on his way home. As he rode along one of the bulrushes\nhappened to knock against something. It split open and, only think! out\nsprang a lovely girl, who said: 'My heart's love, you are mine and I am\nyours; do give me a glass of water.'\n\nBut how could the prince give it her when there was no water at hand?\nSo the lovely maiden flew away. He split the second bulrush as an\nexperiment and just the same thing happened.\n\nHow careful he was of the third bulrush!

Then she asked\nif they knew anything about the three bulrushes, but not one of them\ndid.\n\nThe prince went on his way, and a little further on he found another hut\nin which lived an old man. On being questioned the old man said he knew\nnothing, but begged the prince to stay overnight, and the next morning\nthe old man called all the ravens together, but they too had nothing to\ntell.\n\nThe prince bade him farewell and set out. He wandered so far that he\ncrossed seven kingdoms, and at last, one evening, he came to a little\nhouse in which was an old woman.\n\n'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely.\n\n'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman. 'It is\nlucky for you that you spoke to me or you would have met with a horrible\ndeath. But may I ask where are you going?'\n\n'I am seeking the three bulrushes. Do you know anything about them?'\n\n'I don't know anything myself, but wait till to-morrow. Perhaps I can\ntell you then.' So the next morning she blew on her pipe, and lo!\nand behold every magpie in the world flew up. That is to say, all the\nmagpies except one who had broken a leg and a wing. The old woman sent\nafter it at once, and when she questioned the magpies the crippled one\nwas the only one who knew where the three bulrushes were.\n\nThen the prince started off with the lame magpie. They went on and on\ntill they reached a great stone wall, many, many feet high.\n\n'Now, prince,' said the magpie, 'the three bulrushes are behind that\nwall.'\n\nThe prince wasted no time. He set his horse at the wall and leaped over\nit. Then he looked about for the three bulrushes, pulled them up and\nset off with them on his way home. As he rode along one of the bulrushes\nhappened to knock against something. It split open and, only think! out\nsprang a lovely girl, who said: 'My heart's love, you are mine and I am\nyours; do give me a glass of water.'\n\nBut how could the prince give it her when there was no water at hand?\nSo the lovely maiden flew away. He split the second bulrush as an\nexperiment and just the same thing happened.\n\nHow careful he was of the third bulrush! He waited till he came to a\nwell, and there he split it open, and out sprang a maiden seven times\nlovelier than either of the others, and she too said: 'My heart's love,\nI am yours and you are mine; do give me a glass of water.'\n\nThis time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away, but she\nand the prince promised to love each other always. Then they set out for\nhome.\n\nThey soon reached the prince's country, and as he wished to bring his\npromised bride back in a fine coach he went on to the town to fetch one.\nIn the field where the well was, the king's swineherds and cowherds were\nfeeding their droves, and the prince left Ilonka (for that was her name)\nin their care.\n\nUnluckily the chief swineherd had an ugly old daughter, and whilst the\nprince was away he dressed her up in fine clothes, and threw Ilonka into\nthe well.\n\nThe prince returned before long, bringing with him his father and mother\nand a great train of courtiers to escort Ilonka home. But how they all\nstared when they saw the swineherd's ugly daughter! However, there was\nnothing for it but to take her home; and, two days later, the prince\nmarried her, and his father gave up the crown to him.\n\nBut he had no peace! He knew very well he had been cheated, though he\ncould not think how. Once he desired to have some water brought him from\nthe well into which Ilonka had been thrown. The coachman went for it\nand, in the bucket he pulled up, a pretty little duck was swimming.\nHe looked wonderingly at it, and all of a sudden it disappeared and he\nfound a dirty looking girl standing near him. The girl returned with him\nand managed to get a place as housemaid in the palace.\n\nOf course she was very busy all day long, but whenever she had a little\nspare time she sat down to spin. Her distaff turned of itself and her\nspindle span by itself and the flax wound itself off; and however much\nshe might use there was always plenty left.\n\nWhen the queen--or, rather, the swineherd's daughter--heard of this,\nshe very much wished to have the distaff, but the girl flatly refused\nto give it to her. However, at last she consented on condition that she\nmight sleep one night in the king's room. The queen was very angry, and\nscolded her well; but as she longed to have the distaff she consented,\nthough she gave the king a sleeping draught at supper.\n\nThen the girl went to the king's room looking seven times lovelier than\never. She bent over the sleeper and said: 'My heart's love, I am yours\nand you are mine. Speak to me but once; I am your Ilonka.' But the king\nwas so sound asleep he neither heard nor spoke, and Ilonka left the\nroom, sadly thinking he was ashamed to own her.\n\nSoon after the queen again sent to say that she wanted to buy the\nspindle. The girl agreed to let her have it on the same conditions as\nbefore; but this time, also, the queen took care to give the king a\nsleeping draught. And once more Ilonka went to the king's room and spoke\nto him; whisper as sweetly as she might she could get no answer.\n\nNow some of the king's servants had taken note of the matter, and warned\ntheir master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him,\nas for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught. The\nqueen had no idea that her doings had been discovered; and when, a few\ndays later, she wanted the flax, and had to pay the same price for it,\nshe felt no fears at all.\n\nAt supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things\nto eat and drink, but he declared he was not hungry, and went early to\nbed.\n\nThe queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl, but it was too late\nto recall it; for Ilonka had already entered the king's room, where he\nlay anxiously waiting for something, he knew not what. All of a sudden\nhe saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said: 'My dearest love, I\nam yours and you are mine. Speak to me, for I am your Ilonka.'\n\nAt these words the king's heart bounded within him. He sprang up and\nembraced and kissed her, and she told him all her adventures since the\nmoment he had left her. And when he heard all that Ilonka had suffered,\nand how he had been deceived, he vowed he would be revenged; so he gave\norders that the swineherd, his wife and daughter should all be hanged;\nand so they were.\n\nThe next day the king was married, with great rejoicings, to the fair\nIlonka; and if they are not yet dead--why, they are still living.\n\n\n",
    "question": "What magical traits did Ilonka show when working as a housemaid in the palace?",
    "answer": "Ilonka demonstrated magical traits when she spun flax using a distaff that turned by itself, and her spindle spun by itself, always providing an abundant supply of flax without running out."

The\nqueen had no idea that her doings had been discovered; and when, a few\ndays later, she wanted the flax, and had to pay the same price for it,\nshe felt no fears at all.\n\nAt supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things\nto eat and drink, but he declared he was not hungry, and went early to\nbed.\n\nThe queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl, but it was too late\nto recall it; for Ilonka had already entered the king's room, where he\nlay anxiously waiting for something, he knew not what. All of a sudden\nhe saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said: 'My dearest love, I\nam yours and you are mine. Speak to me, for I am your Ilonka.'\n\nAt these words the king's heart bounded within him. He sprang up and\nembraced and kissed her, and she told him all her adventures since the\nmoment he had left her. And when he heard all that Ilonka had suffered,\nand how he had been deceived, he vowed he would be revenged; so he gave\norders that the swineherd, his wife and daughter should all be hanged;\nand so they were.\n\nThe next day the king was married, with great rejoicings, to the fair\nIlonka; and if they are not yet dead--why, they are still living.\n\n\n",

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "Who was King Archidej and what made his life seemingly perfect?",
    "answer": "King Archidej was a wealthy and handsome ruler who commanded a great army and ruled over many cities. His life seemed perfect because he had everything—luxurious palaces, a wise council, and power—but he was unhappy because he couldn’t find a bride to his liking."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "What news did the merchants bring to King Archidej?",
    "answer": "The merchants told King Archidej about Princess Helena of the Island of Busan, who was extremely beautiful and intelligent, and could match the king in both traits."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "Why did the merchants discourage the king from pursuing Princess Helena?",
    "answer": "They said the island was so far away that it would take ten years to reach and another ten to return. By the time an envoy came back, the princess might have aged and lost her beauty."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "Who were the Seven Simons?",
    "answer": "The Seven Simons were seven peasant brothers, all with the same name (Simon), who were skilled in different trades, taught by their father to be hard-working, honest, and kind."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "What was the first Simon’s special trade?",
    "answer": "The first Simon could build a tall white pillar that reached far above the clouds."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "What ability did the second Simon possess?",
    "answer": "He could climb the pillar and see everything happening in the world from its top, even across great distances."

The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "What was unique about the third Simon’s ship?",
    "answer": "His homemade ship could travel incredibly fast—covering distances in a week that would normally take ten years."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "How did the fourth Simon contribute to their missions?",
    "answer": "He could sink their ship underwater to avoid enemies and raise it again once the danger passed."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "Why was the seventh Simon imprisoned?",
    "answer": "The seventh Simon admitted that his only skill was stealing and hiding things so well that even enchanted vaults couldn't stop him. Though he claimed not to misuse his talent, the king imprisoned him for it."

    "context": "\n\n\nThe Story of the Seven Simons\n\nFar, far away, beyond all sorts of countries, seas and rivers, there\nstood a splendid city where lived King Archidej, who was as good as he\nwas rich and handsome. His great army was made up of men ready to obey\nhis slightest wish; he owned forty times forty cities, and in each city\nhe had ten palaces with silver doors, golden roofs, and crystal windows.\nHis council consisted of the twelve wisest men in the country, whose\nlong beards flowed down over their breasts, each of whom was as learned\nas a whole college. This council always told the king the exact truth.\n\nNow the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy\nanything because he could not find a bride to his mind.\n\nOne day, as he sat in his palace looking out to sea, a great ship sailed\ninto the harbour and several merchants came on shore. Said the king to\nhimself: 'These people have travelled far and beheld many lands. I will\nask them if they have seen any princess who is as clever and as handsome\nas I am.'\n\nSo he ordered the merchants to be brought before him, and when they came\nhe said: 'You have travelled much and visited many wonders. I wish to\nask you a question, and I beg you to answer truthfully.\n\n'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king,\nor a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be\nworthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\n\nThe merchants considered for some time. At last the eldest of them said:\n'I have heard that across many seas, in the Island of Busan, there is a\nmighty king, whose daughter, the Princess Helena, is so lovely that she\ncan certainly not be plainer than your Majesty, and so clever that the\nwisest greybeard cannot guess her riddles.'\n\n'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\n\n'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and\nwe do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The\nprincess is no bride for you.'\n\n'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\n\n'Your Majesty must pardon us; but just think for a moment. Should you\nsend an envoy to the island he will take ten years to get there and ten\nmore to return--twenty years in all. Will not the princess have grown\nold in that time and have lost all her beauty?'\n\nThe king reflected gravely. Then he thanked the merchants, gave them\nleave to trade in his country without paying any duties, and dismissed\nthem.\n\nAfter they were gone the king remained deep in thought. He felt puzzled\nand anxious; so he decided to ride into the country to distract his\nmind, and sent for his huntsmen and falconers. The huntsmen blew their\nhorns, the falconers took their hawks on their wrists, and off they all\nset out across country till they came to a green hedge. On the other\nside of the hedge stretched a great field of maize as far as the eye\ncould reach, and the yellow ears swayed to and fro in the gentle breeze\nlike a rippling sea of gold.\n\nThe king drew rein and admired the field. 'Upon my word,' said he,\n'whoever dug and planted it must be good workmen. If all the fields in\nmy kingdom were as well cared for as this, there would be more bread\nthan my people could eat.' And he wished to know to whom the field\nbelonged.\n\nOff rushed all his followers at once to do his bidding, and found a\nnice, tidy farmhouse, in front of which sat seven peasants, lunching\non rye bread and drinking water. They wore red shirts bound with gold\nbraid, and were so much alike that one could hardly tell one from\nanother.\n\nThe messengers asked: 'Who owns this field of golden maize?' And the\nseven brothers answered: 'The field is ours.'\n\n'And who are you?'\n\n'We are King Archidej's labourers.'\n\nThese answers were repeated to the king, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought before him at once. On being asked who they were, the eldest\nsaid, bowing low:\n\n'We, King Archidej, are your labourers, children of one father and\nmother, and we all have the same name, for each of us is called Simon.\nOur father taught us to be true to our king, and to till the ground,\nand to be kind to our neighbours. He also taught each of us a different\ntrade which he thought might be useful to us, and he bade us not neglect\nour mother earth, which would be sure amply to repay our labour.'\n\nThe king was pleased with the honest peasant, and said: 'You have done\nwell, good people, in planting your field, and now you have a golden\nharvest. But I should like each of you to tell me what special trades\nyour father taught you.'\n\n'My trade, O king!' said the first Simon, 'is not an easy one. If you\nwill give me some workmen and materials I will build you a great white\npillar that shall reach far above the clouds.'\n\n'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your\ntrade?'\n\n'Mine, your Majesty, needs no great cleverness. When my brother has\nbuilt the pillar I can mount it, and from the top, far above the clouds,\nI can see what is happening: in every country under the sun.'\n\n'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\n\n'My work is very simple, sire. You have many ships built by learned men,\nwith all sorts of new and clever improvements. If you wish it I will\nbuild you quite a simple boat--one, two, three, and it's done! But my\nplain little home-made ship is not grand enough for a king. Where other\nships take a year, mine makes the voyage in a day, and where they would\nrequire ten years mine will do the distance in a week.'\n\n'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\n\n'My trade, O king, is really of no importance. Should my brother build\nyou a ship, then let me embark in it. If we should be pursued by an\nenemy I can seize our boat by the prow and sink it to the bottom of the\nsea. When the enemy has sailed off, I can draw it up to the top again.'\n\n'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon\nthe fifth do?'\n\n'My work, your Majesty, is mere smith's work. Order me to build a smithy\nand I will make you a cross-bow, but from which neither the eagle in the\nsky nor the wild beast in the forest is safe. The bolt hits whatever the\neye sees.'\n\n'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth,\ntell me your trade.'\n\n'Sire, it is so simple I am almost ashamed to mention it. If my brother\nhits any creature I catch it quicker than any dog can. If it falls into\nthe water I pick it up out of the greatest depths, and if it is in a\ndark forest I can find it even at midnight.'\n\nThe king was much pleased with the trades and talk of the six brothers,\nand said: 'Thank you, good people; your father did well to teach you all\nthese things. Now follow me to the town, as I want to see what you can\ndo. I need such people as you about me; but when harvest time comes I\nwill send you home with royal presents.'\n\nThe brothers bowed and said: 'As the king wills.' Suddenly the king\nremembered that he had not questioned the seventh Simon, so he turned to\nhim and said: 'Why are you silent? What is your handicraft?'\n\nAnd the seventh Simon answered: 'I have no handicraft, O king; I have\nlearnt nothing. I could not manage it. And if I do know how to do\nanything it is not what might properly be called a real trade--it is\nrather a sort of performance; but it is one which no one--not the king\nhimself--must watch me doing, and I doubt whether this performance of\nmine would please your Majesty.'\n\n'Come, come,' cried the king; 'I will have no excuses, what is this\ntrade?'\n\n'First, sire, give me your royal word that you will not kill me when I\nhave told you. Then you shall hear.'\n\n'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\n\nThen the seventh Simon stepped back a little, cleared his throat, and\nsaid: 'My trade, King Archidej, is of such a kind that the man who\nfollows it in your kingdom generally loses his life and has no hopes of\npardon. There is only one thing I can do really well, and that is--to\nsteal, and to hide the smallest scrap of anything I have stolen. Not\nthe deepest vault, even if its lock were enchanted, could prevent my\nstealing anything out of it that I wished to have.'\n\nWhen the king heard this he fell into a passion. 'I will not pardon\nyou, you rascal,' he cried; 'I will shut you up in my deepest dungeon on\nbread and water till you have forgotten such a trade. Indeed, it would\nbe better to put you to death at once, and I've a good mind to do so.'\n\n'Don't kill me, O king! I am really not as bad as you think. Why, had I\nchosen, I could have robbed the royal treasury, have bribed your judges\nto let me off, and built a white marble palace with what was left.\nBut though I know how to steal I don't do it. You yourself asked me my\ntrade. If you kill me you will break your royal word.'\n\n'Very well,' said the king, 'I will not kill you. I pardon you. But from\nthis hour you shall be shut up in a dark dungeon. Here, guards! away\nwith him to the prison. But you six Simons follow me and be assured of\nmy royal favour.'\n\nSo the six Simons followed the king. The seventh Simon was seized by the\nguards, who put him in chains and threw him in prison with only bread\nand water for food. Next day the king gave the first Simon carpenters,\nmasons, smiths and labourers, with great stores of iron, mortar, and the\nlike, and Simon began to build. And he built his great white pillar\nfar, far up into the clouds, as high as the nearest stars; but the other\nstars were higher still.\n\nThen the second Simon climbed up the pillar and saw and heard all that\nwas going on through the whole world. When he came down he had all sorts\nof wonderful things to tell. How one king was marching in battle against\nanother, and which was likely to be the victor. How, in another place,\ngreat rejoicings were going on, while in a third people were dying of\nfamine. In fact there was not the smallest event going on over the earth\nthat was hidden from him.\n\nNext the third Simon began. He stretched out his arms, once, twice,\nthrice, and the wonder-ship was ready. At a sign from the king it was\nlaunched, and floated proudly and safely like a bird on the waves.\nInstead of ropes it had wires for rigging, and musicians played on them\nwith fiddle bows and made lovely music. As the ship swam about, the\nfourth Simon seized the prow with his strong hand, and in a moment it\nwas gone--sunk to the bottom of the sea. An hour passed, and then the\nship floated again, drawn up by Simon's left hand, while in his right he\nbrought a gigantic fish from the depth of the ocean for the royal table.\n\nWhilst this was going on the fifth Simon had built his forge and\nhammered out his iron, and when the king returned from the harbour the\nmagic cross-bow was made.\n\nHis Majesty went out into an open field at once, looked up into the sky\nand saw, far, far away, an eagle flying up towards the sun and looking\nlike a little speck.\n\n'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\n\nSimon only smiled; he lifted his cross-bow, took aim, fired, and the\neagle fell. As it was falling the sixth Simon ran with a dish, caught\nthe bird before it fell to earth and brought it to the king.\n\n'Many thanks, my brave lads,' said the king; 'I see that each of you is\nindeed a master of his trade. You shall be richly rewarded. But now rest\nand have your dinner.'\n\nThe six Simons bowed and went to dinner. But they had hardly begun\nbefore a messenger came to say that the king wanted to see them. They\nobeyed at once and found him surrounded by all his court and men of\nstate.\n\n'Listen, my good fellows,' cried the king, as soon as he saw them. 'Hear\nwhat my wise counsellors have thought of. As you, Simon the second,\ncan see the whole world from the top of the great pillar, I want you to\nclimb up and to see and hear. For I am told that, far away, across many\nseas, is the great kingdom of the Island of Busan, and that the daughter\nof the king is the beautiful Princess Helena.'\n\nOff ran the second Simon and clambered quickly up the pillar. He gazed\naround, listened on all sides, and then slid down to report to the king.\n\n'Sire, I have obeyed your orders. Far away I saw the Island of Busan.\nThe king is a mighty monarch, but full of pride, harsh and cruel. He\nsits on his throne and declares that no prince or king on earth is good\nenough for his lovely daughter, that he will give her to none, and\nthat if any king asks for her hand he will declare war against him and\ndestroy his kingdom.'\n\n'Has the king of Busan a great army?' asked King Archidej; 'is his\ncountry far off?'\n\n'As far as I could judge,' replied Simon, 'it would take you nearly ten\nyears in fair weather to sail there. But if the weather were stormy\nwe might say twelve. I saw the army being reviewed. It is not so very\nlarge--a hundred thousand men at arms and a hundred thousand knights.\nBesides these, he has a strong bodyguard and a good many cross-bowmen.\nAltogether you may say another hundred thousand, and there is a picked\nbody of heroes who reserve themselves for great occasions requiring\nparticular courage.'\n\nThe king sat for some time lost in thought. At last he said to the\nnobles and courtiers standing round: 'I am determined to marry the\nPrincess Helena, but how shall I do it?'\n\nThe nobles, courtiers and counsellors said nothing, but tried to hide\nbehind each other. Then the third Simon said:\n\n'Pardon me, your Majesty, if I offer my advice. You wish to go to the\nIsland of Busan? What can be easier? In my ship you will get there in a\nweek instead of in ten years. But ask your council to advise you what\nto do when you arrive--in one word, whether you will win the princess\npeacefully or by war?'\n\nBut the wise men were as silent as ever.\n\nThe king frowned, and was about to say something sharp, when the Court\nFool pushed his way to the front and said: 'Dear me, what are all you\nclever people so puzzled about? The matter is quite clear. As it seems\nit will not take long to reach the island why not send the seventh\nSimon? He will steal the fair maiden fast enough, and then the king,\nher father, may consider how he is going to bring his army over here--it\nwill take him ten years to do it!---no less! What do you think of my\nplan?'\n\n'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be\nrewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the\nseventh Simon before me.'\n\nNot many minutes later, Simon the seventh stood before the king, who\nexplained to him what he wished done, and also that to steal for the\nbenefit of his king and country was by no means a wrong thing, though it\nwas very wrong to steal for his own advantage.\n\nThe youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his\nhead.\n\n'Come,' said the king, 'tell me truly. Do you think you could steal the\nPrincess Helena?'\n\n'Why should I not steal her, sire? The thing is easy enough. Let my\nbrother's ship be laden with rich stuffs, brocades, Persian carpets,\npearls and jewels. Send me in the ship. Give me my four middle brothers\nas companions, and keep the two others as hostages.'\n\nWhen the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing,\nand he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do\nhis bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready\nto start.\n\nThe five Simons took leave of the king, went on board, and had no sooner\nset sail than they were almost out of sight. The ship cut through the\nwaters like a falcon through the air, and just a week after starting\nsighted the Island of Busan. The coast appeared to be strongly guarded,\nand from afar the watchman on a high tower called out: 'Halt and anchor!\nWho are you? Where do you come from, and what do you want?'\n\nThe seventh Simon answered from the ship: 'We are peaceful people. We\ncome from the country of the great and good King Archidej, and we bring\nforeign wares--rich brocades, carpets, and costly jewels, which we wish\nto show to your king and the princess. We desire to trade--to sell, to\nbuy, and to exchange.'\n\nThe brothers launched a small boat, took some of their valuable goods\nwith them, rowed to shore and went up to the palace. The princess sat\nin a rose-red room, and when she saw the brothers coming near she called\nher nurse and other women, and told them to inquire who and what these\npeople were, and what they wanted.\n\nThe seventh Simon answered the nurse: 'We come from the country of the\nwise and good King Archidej,' said he, 'and we have brought all sorts\nof goods for sale. We trust the king of this country may condescend\nto welcome us, and to let his servants take charge of our wares. If he\nconsiders them worthy to adorn his followers we shall be content.'\n\nThis speech was repeated to the princess, who ordered the brothers to\nbe brought to the red-room at once. They bowed respectfully to her and\ndisplayed some splendid velvets and brocades, and opened cases of pearls\nand precious stones. Such beautiful things had never been seen in the\nisland, and the nurse and waiting women stood bewildered by all the\nmagnificence. They whispered together that they had never beheld\nanything like it. The princess too saw and wondered, and her eyes could\nnot weary of looking at the lovely things, or her fingers of stroking\nthe rich soft stuffs, and of holding up the sparkling jewels to the\nlight.\n\n'Fairest of princesses,' said Simon. 'Be pleased to order your\nwaiting-maids to accept the silks and velvets, and let your women trim\ntheir head-dresses with the jewels; these are no special treasures.\nBut permit me to say that they are as nothing to the many coloured\ntapestries, the gorgeous stones and ropes of pearls in our ship. We did\nnot like to bring more with us, not knowing what your royal taste might\nbe; but if it seems good to you to honour our ship with a visit, you\nmight condescend to choose such things as were pleasing in your eyes.'\n\nThis polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the\nking and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most\nsplendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I\nlike.'\n\nThe king thought and thought, frowned hard and rubbed his ear. At last\nhe gave consent, and ordered out his royal yacht, with 100 cross-bows,\n100 knights, and 1,000 soldiers, to escort the Princess Helena.\n\nOff sailed the yacht with the princess and her escort. The brothers\nSimon came on board to conduct the princess to their ship, and, led by\nthe brothers and followed by her nurse and other women, she crossed the\ncrystal plank from one vessel to another.\n\nThe seventh Simon spread out his goods, and had so many curious\nand interesting tales to tell about them, that the princess forgot\neverything else in looking and listening, so that she did not know that\nthe fourth Simon had seized the prow of the ship, and that all of a\nsudden it had vanished from sight, and was racing along in the depths of\nthe sea.\n\nThe crew of the royal yacht shouted aloud, the knights stood still with\nterror, the soldiers were struck dumb and hung their heads. There was\nnothing to be done but to sail back and tell the king of his loss.\n\nHow he wept and stormed! 'Oh, light of my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed\npunished for my pride. I thought no one good enough to be your husband,\nand now you are lost in the depths of the sea, and have left me alone!\nAs for all of you who saw this thing--away with you! Let them be put in\nirons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them\nto death!'\n\nWhilst the King of Busan was raging and lamenting in this fashion,\nSimon's ship was swimming like any fish under the sea, and when the\nisland was well out of sight he brought it up to the surface again. At\nthat moment the princess recollected herself. 'Nurse,' said she, 'we\nhave been gazing at these wonders only too long. I hope my father won't\nbe vexed at our delay.'\n\nShe tore herself away and stepped on deck. Neither the yacht nor the\nisland was in sight! Helena wrung her hands and beat her breast. Then\nshe changed herself into a white swan and flew off. But the fifth Simon\nseized his bow and shot the swan, and the sixth Simon did not let it\nfall into the water but caught it in the ship, and the swan turned into\na silver fish, but Simon lost no time and caught the fish, when, quick\nas thought, the fish turned into a black mouse and ran about the ship.\nIt darted towards a hole, but before it could reach it Simon sprang upon\nit more swiftly than any cat, and then the little mouse turned once more\ninto the beautiful Princess Helena.\n\nEarly one morning King Archidej sat thoughtfully at his window gazing\nout to sea. His heart was sad and he would neither eat nor drink. His\nthoughts were full of the Princess Helena, who was as lovely as a dream.\nIs that a white gull he sees flying towards the shore, or is it a sail?\nNo, it is no gull, it is the wonder-ship flying along with billowing\nsails. Its flags wave, the fiddlers play on the wire rigging, the anchor\nis thrown out and the crystal plank laid from the ship to the pier. The\nlovely Helena steps across the plank. She shines like the sun, and the\nstars of heaven seem to sparkle in her eyes.\n\nUp sprang King Archidej in haste: 'Hurry, hurry,' he cried. 'Let us\nhasten to meet her! Let the bugles sound and the joy bells be rung!'\n\nAnd the whole Court swarmed with courtiers and servants. Golden carpets\nwere laid down and the great gates thrown open to welcome the princess.\n\nKing Archidej went out himself, took her by the hand and led her into\nthe royal apartments.\n\n'Madam,' said he, 'the fame of your beauty had reached me, but I had not\ndared to expect such loveliness. Still I will not keep you here against\nyour will. If you wish it, the wonder-ship shall take you back to your\nfather and your own country; but if you will consent to stay here, then\nreign over me and my country as our queen.'\n\nWhat more is there to tell? It is not hard to guess that the princess\nlistened to the king's wooing, and their betrothal took place with great\npomp and rejoicings.\n\nThe brothers Simon were sent again to the Island of Busan with a letter\nto the king from his daughter to invite him to their wedding. And the\nwonder-ship arrived at the Island of Busan just as all the knights and\nsoldiers who had escorted the princess were being led out to execution.\n\nThen the seventh Simon cried out from the ship: 'Stop! stop! I bring a\nletter from the Princess Helena!'\n\nThe King of Busan read the letter over and over again, and ordered the\nknights and soldiers to be set free. He entertained King Archidej's\nambassadors hospitably, and sent his blessing to his daughter, but he\ncould not be brought to attend the wedding.\n\nWhen the wonder-ship got home King Archidej and Princess Helena were\nenchanted with the news it brought.\n\nThe king sent for the seven Simons. 'A thousand thanks to you, my brave\nfellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you\nwill out of my treasury. Tell me if there is anything else you wish for\nand I will give it you, my good friends. Do you wish to be made nobles,\nor to govern towns? Only speak.'\n\nThen the eldest Simon bowed and said: 'We are plain folk, your Majesty,\nand understand simple things best. What figures should we cut as nobles\nor governors? Nor do we desire gold. We have our fields which give us\nfood, and as much money as we need. If you wish to reward us then grant\nthat our land may be free of taxes, and of your goodness pardon the\nseventh Simon. He is not the first who has been a thief by trade and he\nwill certainly not be the last.'\n\n'So be it,' said the king; 'your land shall be free of all taxes, and\nSimon the seventh is pardoned.'\n\nThen the king gave each brother a goblet of wine and invited them to the\nwedding feast. And what a feast that was!",
    "question": "What did the king do after learning the skills of the six Simons?",
    "answer": "He rewarded them with his royal favor, tested their abilities, and allowed them to serve him, especially since their skills could help in his quest to win Princess Helena."

    "context": "\nLucky Luck\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was\nabout eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against\na neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person. He bade\nhis son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to\nmarry till his return.\n\nTime went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of\nmarrying. But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to\nthink that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so\nmuch that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,\nwhat his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it\nwas ten years since the king went out to war. Then the prince called his\ncourtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride. He\nhardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when,\nsuddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.\n\nThe king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions\nto ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting\nfor him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very\nangry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any\nof my people with you.'\n\nOnly one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part\nfrom him. They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place\ncalled Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the\nprince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.\n\nHe was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had\ncharming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her\nparents gave her to him with joy. The wedding took place at once, and\nthe feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of\nthe month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they\nspent the first evening at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only\nthe faithful servant kept watch. About midnight he heard three crows,\nwho had flown to the roof, talking together.\n\n'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a\npity they should lose their lives so soon.'\n\n'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the\nbridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over\nit. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be\nturned to stone up to his knees.'\n\nThe crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon\nthem followed three pigeons.\n\n'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will\nperish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet\nthem which looks as new as paint. But when they are seated in it a\nraging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then\nit will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who\nhears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his\nwaist.'\n\nWith that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and\nthis is what they said:\n\n'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge\nand the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold\nembroidered robe. When they put these on they will be burnt up at once.\nBut whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to\nfoot.'\n\nEarly next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to\ntell each other their dreams. At last the servant said:\n\n'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all\nI asked we should get home safe and sound; but if you did not we should\ncertainly be lost. My dreams never deceive me, so I entreat you to\nfollow my advice during the rest of the journey.'\n\n'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but\nclouds. Still, to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you\nwish.'\n\nWith that they set out on their journey.\n\nAt midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the\nservant said: 'Let us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk\na little way. The town is not far off and we can easily get another\ncarriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out\nmuch longer.'\n\nThe prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so\nunsafe as his servant said; but he had given his word and he held to it.\n\nThey got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and\nhis bride walked over the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the\nhorses through the stream so as to water and bathe them.\n\nThey reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in\nthe town, which was quite near, and set off once more on their travels;\nbut they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who\nsaid to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this\nbeautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own\ncountry and amongst your own people.'\n\nThe prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant\nsaid: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get\nin if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\n\nThe prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well\nover the servant said: 'It is as bad as it is smart'; and with that\nhe knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the one that they had\nbought.\n\nAt last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting\nfor them, who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the\nprince and his bride, and begged that they would wear them for their\nstate entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do\nwith them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to\ndestroy the robes.\n\nThe old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed;\nthat his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to\nhim now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to\nknow how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed\nrejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful\ncarriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why you had\nthem destroyed.'\n\n'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their\ndestruction; but my servant had begged to direct everything on the\njourney and I had promised him that he should do so. He declared that we\ncould not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'\n\nThe old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together\nand condemned the servant to death.\n\nThe gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant\nwas led out and his sentence read to him.\n\nThe rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed\na few last words. 'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care. 'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about\nfor three days more, and at the end of the third day saw a little town.\nIt was quite late when he reached it, but he could discover no light\nanywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house\nwhere he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story. 'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "Why did the prince decide to leave home and search for a bride after ten years?",
    "answer": "Although his father explicitly ordered him not to marry until the war was over, the prince grew restless and lonely by his twenty-fifth birthday—ten years after his father left—and became eager for companionship, prompting him to break his father’s command and seek a wife."

'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "What prophecy did the three crows reveal at the inn, and what was the penalty for revealing it?",
    "answer": "The three crows foretold that when the couple crossed the bridge over the Gold Stream at noon the next day, it would collapse under them. They also warned that anyone who repeated their secret would be turned to stone up to the knees."

    "context": "\nLucky Luck\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was\nabout eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against\na neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person. He bade\nhis son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to\nmarry till his return.\n\nTime went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of\nmarrying. But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to\nthink that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so\nmuch that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,\nwhat his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it\nwas ten years since the king went out to war. Then the prince called his\ncourtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride. He\nhardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when,\nsuddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.\n\nThe king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions\nto ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting\nfor him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very\nangry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any\nof my people with you.'\n\nOnly one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part\nfrom him. They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place\ncalled Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the\nprince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.\n\nHe was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had\ncharming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her\nparents gave her to him with joy. The wedding took place at once, and\nthe feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of\nthe month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they\nspent the first evening at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only\nthe faithful servant kept watch. About midnight he heard three crows,\nwho had flown to the roof, talking together.\n\n'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a\npity they should lose their lives so soon.'\n\n'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the\nbridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over\nit. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be\nturned to stone up to his knees.'\n\nThe crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon\nthem followed three pigeons.\n\n'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will\nperish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet\nthem which looks as new as paint. But when they are seated in it a\nraging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then\nit will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who\nhears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his\nwaist.'\n\nWith that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and\nthis is what they said:\n\n'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge\nand the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold\nembroidered robe. When they put these on they will be burnt up at once.\nBut whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to\nfoot.'\n\nEarly next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to\ntell each other their dreams. At last the servant said:\n\n'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all\nI asked we should get home safe and sound; but if you did not we should\ncertainly be lost. My dreams never deceive me, so I entreat you to\nfollow my advice during the rest of the journey.'\n\n'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but\nclouds. Still, to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you\nwish.'\n\nWith that they set out on their journey.\n\nAt midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the\nservant said: 'Let us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk\na little way. The town is not far off and we can easily get another\ncarriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out\nmuch longer.'\n\nThe prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so\nunsafe as his servant said; but he had given his word and he held to it.\n\nThey got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and\nhis bride walked over the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the\nhorses through the stream so as to water and bathe them.\n\nThey reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in\nthe town, which was quite near, and set off once more on their travels;\nbut they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who\nsaid to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this\nbeautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own\ncountry and amongst your own people.'\n\nThe prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant\nsaid: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get\nin if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\n\nThe prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well\nover the servant said: 'It is as bad as it is smart'; and with that\nhe knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the one that they had\nbought.\n\nAt last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting\nfor them, who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the\nprince and his bride, and begged that they would wear them for their\nstate entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do\nwith them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to\ndestroy the robes.\n\nThe old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed;\nthat his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to\nhim now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to\nknow how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed\nrejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful\ncarriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why you had\nthem destroyed.'\n\n'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their\ndestruction; but my servant had begged to direct everything on the\njourney and I had promised him that he should do so. He declared that we\ncould not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'\n\nThe old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together\nand condemned the servant to death.\n\nThe gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant\nwas led out and his sentence read to him.\n\nThe rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed\na few last words. 'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care. 'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about\nfor three days more, and at the end of the third day saw a little town.\nIt was quite late when he reached it, but he could discover no light\nanywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house\nwhere he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story.

But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story. 'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "What three dangers did the royal couple face on their journey home, and how did they escape each one?",
    "answer": "- **Bridge collapse** at the Gold Stream (crows’ warning): they walked instead of riding in the carriage. \n   - **Whirlwind carriage ride** (pigeons’ warning): they refused the king’s fancy carriage and destroyed it at the servant’s insistence. \n   - **Burning robes** (eagles’ warning): they destroyed the king’s gold-embroidered robes rather than wear them."

    "context": "\nLucky Luck\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was\nabout eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against\na neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person. He bade\nhis son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to\nmarry till his return.\n\nTime went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of\nmarrying. But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to\nthink that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so\nmuch that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,\nwhat his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it\nwas ten years since the king went out to war. Then the prince called his\ncourtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride. He\nhardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when,\nsuddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.\n\nThe king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions\nto ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting\nfor him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very\nangry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any\nof my people with you.'\n\nOnly one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part\nfrom him. They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place\ncalled Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the\nprince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.\n\nHe was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had\ncharming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her\nparents gave her to him with joy. The wedding took place at once, and\nthe feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of\nthe month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they\nspent the first evening at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only\nthe faithful servant kept watch. About midnight he heard three crows,\nwho had flown to the roof, talking together.\n\n'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a\npity they should lose their lives so soon.'\n\n'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the\nbridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over\nit. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be\nturned to stone up to his knees.'\n\nThe crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon\nthem followed three pigeons.\n\n'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will\nperish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet\nthem which looks as new as paint. But when they are seated in it a\nraging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then\nit will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who\nhears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his\nwaist.'\n\nWith that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and\nthis is what they said:\n\n'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge\nand the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold\nembroidered robe. When they put these on they will be burnt up at once.\nBut whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to\nfoot.'\n\nEarly next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to\ntell each other their dreams. At last the servant said:\n\n'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all\nI asked we should get home safe and sound; but if you did not we should\ncertainly be lost. My dreams never deceive me, so I entreat you to\nfollow my advice during the rest of the journey.'\n\n'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but\nclouds. Still, to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you\nwish.'\n\nWith that they set out on their journey.\n\nAt midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the\nservant said: 'Let us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk\na little way. The town is not far off and we can easily get another\ncarriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out\nmuch longer.'\n\nThe prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so\nunsafe as his servant said; but he had given his word and he held to it.\n\nThey got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and\nhis bride walked over the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the\nhorses through the stream so as to water and bathe them.\n\nThey reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in\nthe town, which was quite near, and set off once more on their travels;\nbut they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who\nsaid to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this\nbeautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own\ncountry and amongst your own people.'\n\nThe prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant\nsaid: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get\nin if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\n\nThe prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well\nover the servant said: 'It is as bad as it is smart'; and with that\nhe knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the one that they had\nbought.\n\nAt last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting\nfor them, who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the\nprince and his bride, and begged that they would wear them for their\nstate entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do\nwith them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to\ndestroy the robes.\n\nThe old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed;\nthat his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to\nhim now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to\nknow how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed\nrejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful\ncarriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why you had\nthem destroyed.'\n\n'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their\ndestruction; but my servant had begged to direct everything on the\njourney and I had promised him that he should do so. He declared that we\ncould not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'\n\nThe old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together\nand condemned the servant to death.\n\nThe gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant\nwas led out and his sentence read to him.\n\nThe rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed\na few last words. 'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care. 'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.

He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about\nfor three days more, and at the end of the third day saw a little town.\nIt was quite late when he reached it, but he could discover no light\nanywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house\nwhere he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story. 'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "What led the king to condemn the faithful servant to death, despite the servant’s proven loyalty?",
    "answer": "The king, ignorant of the servant’s heroism, believed the servant’s destruction of his gifts was deliberate defiance rather than life-saving precaution, so he turned against him and sentenced him to death for disobeying royal commands."

    "context": "\nLucky Luck\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was\nabout eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against\na neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person. He bade\nhis son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to\nmarry till his return.\n\nTime went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of\nmarrying. But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to\nthink that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so\nmuch that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,\nwhat his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it\nwas ten years since the king went out to war. Then the prince called his\ncourtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride. He\nhardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when,\nsuddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.\n\nThe king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions\nto ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting\nfor him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very\nangry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any\nof my people with you.'\n\nOnly one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part\nfrom him. They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place\ncalled Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the\nprince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.\n\nHe was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had\ncharming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her\nparents gave her to him with joy. The wedding took place at once, and\nthe feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of\nthe month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they\nspent the first evening at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only\nthe faithful servant kept watch. About midnight he heard three crows,\nwho had flown to the roof, talking together.\n\n'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a\npity they should lose their lives so soon.'\n\n'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the\nbridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over\nit. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be\nturned to stone up to his knees.'\n\nThe crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon\nthem followed three pigeons.\n\n'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will\nperish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet\nthem which looks as new as paint. But when they are seated in it a\nraging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then\nit will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who\nhears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his\nwaist.'\n\nWith that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and\nthis is what they said:\n\n'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge\nand the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold\nembroidered robe. When they put these on they will be burnt up at once.\nBut whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to\nfoot.'\n\nEarly next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to\ntell each other their dreams. At last the servant said:\n\n'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all\nI asked we should get home safe and sound; but if you did not we should\ncertainly be lost. My dreams never deceive me, so I entreat you to\nfollow my advice during the rest of the journey.'\n\n'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but\nclouds. Still, to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you\nwish.'\n\nWith that they set out on their journey.\n\nAt midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the\nservant said: 'Let us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk\na little way. The town is not far off and we can easily get another\ncarriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out\nmuch longer.'\n\nThe prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so\nunsafe as his servant said; but he had given his word and he held to it.\n\nThey got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and\nhis bride walked over the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the\nhorses through the stream so as to water and bathe them.\n\nThey reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in\nthe town, which was quite near, and set off once more on their travels;\nbut they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who\nsaid to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this\nbeautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own\ncountry and amongst your own people.'\n\nThe prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant\nsaid: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get\nin if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\n\nThe prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well\nover the servant said: 'It is as bad as it is smart'; and with that\nhe knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the one that they had\nbought.\n\nAt last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting\nfor them, who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the\nprince and his bride, and begged that they would wear them for their\nstate entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do\nwith them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to\ndestroy the robes.\n\nThe old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed;\nthat his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to\nhim now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to\nknow how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed\nrejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful\ncarriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why you had\nthem destroyed.'\n\n'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their\ndestruction; but my servant had begged to direct everything on the\njourney and I had promised him that he should do so. He declared that we\ncould not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'\n\nThe old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together\nand condemned the servant to death.\n\nThe gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant\nwas led out and his sentence read to him.\n\nThe rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed\na few last words. 'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care. 'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck.

'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about\nfor three days more, and at the end of the third day saw a little town.\nIt was quite late when he reached it, but he could discover no light\nanywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house\nwhere he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story. 'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "Who or what ultimately pointed the prince to Lucky Luck, and what tasks did Lucky Luck set before him?",
    "answer": "The prince’s old nurse, still at court, directed him to seek Lucky Luck. Lucky Luck’s mother advised the prince to find her son digging in the vineyard, work silently beside him, and then freely recount his plight so Lucky Luck could offer answers."

    "context": "\nLucky Luck\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had an only son. When the lad was\nabout eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against\na neighbouring country, and the king led his troops in person. He bade\nhis son act as Regent in his absence, but ordered him on no account to\nmarry till his return.\n\nTime went by. The prince ruled the country and never even thought of\nmarrying. But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to\nthink that it might be rather nice to have a wife, and he thought so\nmuch that at last he got quite eager about it. He remembered, however,\nwhat his father had said, and waited some time longer, till at last it\nwas ten years since the king went out to war. Then the prince called his\ncourtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride. He\nhardly knew which way to go, so he wandered about for twenty days, when,\nsuddenly, he found himself in his father's camp.\n\nThe king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions\nto ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting\nfor him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very\nangry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any\nof my people with you.'\n\nOnly one faithful servant stayed with the prince and refused to part\nfrom him. They journeyed over hill and dale till they came to a place\ncalled Goldtown. The King of Goldtown had a lovely daughter, and the\nprince, who soon heard about her beauty, could not rest till he saw her.\n\nHe was very kindly received, for he was extremely good-looking and had\ncharming manners, so he lost no time in asking for her hand and her\nparents gave her to him with joy. The wedding took place at once, and\nthe feasting and rejoicings went on for a whole month. At the end of\nthe month they set off for home, but as the journey was a long one they\nspent the first evening at an inn. Everyone in the house slept, and only\nthe faithful servant kept watch. About midnight he heard three crows,\nwho had flown to the roof, talking together.\n\n'That's a handsome couple which arrived here tonight. It seems quite a\npity they should lose their lives so soon.'\n\n'Truly,' said the second crow; 'for to-morrow, when midday strikes, the\nbridge over the Gold Stream will break just as they are driving over\nit. But, listen! whoever overhears and tells what we have said will be\nturned to stone up to his knees.'\n\nThe crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon\nthem followed three pigeons.\n\n'Even if the prince and princess get safe over the bridge they will\nperish,' said they; 'for the king is going to send a carriage to meet\nthem which looks as new as paint. But when they are seated in it a\nraging wind will rise and whirl the carriage away into the clouds. Then\nit will fall suddenly to earth, and they will be killed. But anyone who\nhears and betrays what we have said will be turned to stone up to his\nwaist.'\n\nWith that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and\nthis is what they said:\n\n'If the young couple does manage to escape the dangers of the bridge\nand the carriage, the king means to send them each a splendid gold\nembroidered robe. When they put these on they will be burnt up at once.\nBut whoever hears and repeats this will turn to stone from head to\nfoot.'\n\nEarly next morning the travellers got up and breakfasted. They began to\ntell each other their dreams. At last the servant said:\n\n'Gracious prince, I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all\nI asked we should get home safe and sound; but if you did not we should\ncertainly be lost. My dreams never deceive me, so I entreat you to\nfollow my advice during the rest of the journey.'\n\n'Don't make such a fuss about a dream,' said the prince; 'dreams are but\nclouds. Still, to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you\nwish.'\n\nWith that they set out on their journey.\n\nAt midday they reached the Gold Stream. When they got to the bridge the\nservant said: 'Let us leave the carriage here, my prince, and walk\na little way. The town is not far off and we can easily get another\ncarriage there, for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out\nmuch longer.'\n\nThe prince looked well at the carriage. He did not think it looked so\nunsafe as his servant said; but he had given his word and he held to it.\n\nThey got down and loaded the horses with the luggage. The prince and\nhis bride walked over the bridge, but the servant said he would ride the\nhorses through the stream so as to water and bathe them.\n\nThey reached the other side without harm, and bought a new carriage in\nthe town, which was quite near, and set off once more on their travels;\nbut they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who\nsaid to the prince: 'His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this\nbeautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own\ncountry and amongst your own people.'\n\nThe prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant\nsaid: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get\nin if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\n\nThe prince made no objections, and after looking the carriage well\nover the servant said: 'It is as bad as it is smart'; and with that\nhe knocked it all to pieces, and they went on in the one that they had\nbought.\n\nAt last they reached the frontier; there another messenger was waiting\nfor them, who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the\nprince and his bride, and begged that they would wear them for their\nstate entry. But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do\nwith them, and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to\ndestroy the robes.\n\nThe old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed;\nthat his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to\nhim now he was married, for that was the law of the land. He longed to\nknow how the prince had escaped, and said: 'My dear son, I do indeed\nrejoice to have you safely back, but I cannot imagine why the beautiful\ncarriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you; why you had\nthem destroyed.'\n\n'Indeed, sire,' said the prince, 'I was myself much annoyed at their\ndestruction; but my servant had begged to direct everything on the\njourney and I had promised him that he should do so. He declared that we\ncould not possibly get home safely unless I did as he told me.'\n\nThe old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together\nand condemned the servant to death.\n\nThe gallows was put up in the square in front of the palace. The servant\nwas led out and his sentence read to him.\n\nThe rope was being placed round his neck, when he begged to be allowed\na few last words. 'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care.

'On our journey home,' he said, 'we spent the first\nnight at an inn. I did not sleep but kept watch all night.' And then he\nwent on to tell what the crows had said, and as he spoke he turned to\nstone up to his knees. The prince called to him to say no more as he had\nproved his innocence. But the servant paid no heed to him, and by the\ntime his story was done he had turned to stone from head to foot.\n\nOh! how grieved the prince was to lose his faithful servant! And what\npained him most was the thought that he was lost through his very\nfaithfulness, and he determined to travel all over the world and never\nrest till he found some means of restoring him to life.\n\nNow there lived at Court an old woman who had been the prince's nurse.\nTo her he confided all his plans, and left his wife, the princess, in\nher care. 'You have a long way before you, my son,' said the old woman;\n'you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck. If he cannot\nhelp you no one on earth can.'\n\nSo the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked\ntill he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for\nthree days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the\nthird day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he\nspent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him:\n'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\n\nAnd the prince told him.\n\n'Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question: Why is it\nthat though I have an excellent mill, with all its machinery complete,\nand get plenty of grain to grind, I am so poor that I hardly know how to\nlive from one day to another?'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way. He wandered about\nfor three days more, and at the end of the third day saw a little town.\nIt was quite late when he reached it, but he could discover no light\nanywhere, and walked almost right through it without finding a house\nwhere he could turn in. But far away at the end of the town he saw a\nlight in a window. He went straight to it and in the house were three\ngirls playing a game together. The prince asked for a night's lodging\nand they took him in, gave him some supper and got a room ready for him,\nwhere he slept.\n\nNext morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he\ntold them his story. 'Gracious prince,' said the maidens, 'do ask Lucky\nLuck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover\nhas come to woo us, though we are good, pretty, and very industrious.'\n\nThe prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.\n\nThen he came to a great forest and wandered about in it from morning to\nnight and from night to morning before he got near the other end. Here\nhe found a pretty stream which was different from other streams as,\ninstead of flowing, it stood still and began to talk: 'Sir prince, tell\nme what brings you into these wilds? I must have been flowing here a\nhundred years and more and no one has ever yet come by.'\n\n'I will tell you,' answered the prince, 'if you will divide yourself so\nthat I may walk through.'\n\nThe stream parted at once, and the prince walked through without wetting\nhis feet; and directly he got to the other side he told his story as he\nhad promised.\n\n'Oh, do ask Lucky Luck,' cried the brook, 'why, though I am such a\nclear, bright, rapid stream I never have a fish or any other living\ncreature in my waters.'\n\nThe prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.\n\nWhen he got quite clear of the forest he walked on through a lovely\nvalley till he reached a little house thatched with rushes, and he went\nin to rest for he was very tired.\n\nEverything in the house was beautifully clean and tidy, and a cheerful\nhonest-looking old woman was sitting by the fire.\n\n'Good-morning, mother,' said the prince.\n\n'May Luck be with you, my son. What brings you into these parts?'\n\n'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\n\n'Then you have come to the right place, my son, for I am his mother. He\nis not at home just now, he is out digging in the vineyard. Do you go\ntoo. Here are two spades. When you find him begin to dig, but don't\nspeak a word to him. It is now eleven o'clock. When he sits down to\neat his dinner sit beside him and eat with him. After dinner he will\nquestion you, and then tell him all your troubles freely. He will answer\nwhatever you may ask.'\n\nWith that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as\nshe had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.\n\nAll of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort\nof man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\n\n'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince\nwhose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how\nto help him.'\n\n'And you do well, for he deserves everything. Go back, and when you\nget home your wife will just have had a little boy. Take three drops of\nblood from the child's little finger, rub them on your servant's wrists\nwith a blade of grass and he will return to life.'\n\n'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him.\n'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living\ncreature in it. Why is this?'\n\n'Because no one has ever been drowned in the stream. But take care, in\ncrossing, to get as near the other side as you can before you say so, or\nyou may be the first victim yourself.'\n\n'Another question, please, before I go. On my way here I lodged\none night in the house of three maidens. All were well-mannered,\nhard-working, and pretty, and yet none has had a wooer. Why was this?'\n\n'Because they always throw out their sweepings in the face of the sun.'\n\n'And why is it that a miller, who has a large mill with all the best\nmachinery and gets plenty of corn to grind is so poor that he can hardly\nlive from day to day?'\n\n'Because the miller keeps everything for himself, and does not give to\nthose who need it.'\n\nThe prince wrote down the answers to his questions, took a friendly\nleave of Lucky Luck, and set off for home.\n\nWhen he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news.\n'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he\nwalked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and\nshouted out:\n\n'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living\ncreature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the stream swelled and\noverflowed till it reached the rock up which he had climbed, and dashed\nso far up it that the spray flew over him. But he clung on tight, and\nafter failing to reach him three times the stream returned to its proper\ncourse. Then the prince climbed down, dried himself in the sun, and set\nout on his march home.\n\nHe spent the night once more at the mill and gave the miller his answer,\nand by-and-by he told the three sisters not to throw out all their\nsweepings in the face of the sun.\n\nThe prince had hardly arrived at home when some thieves tried to ford\nthe stream with a fine horse they had stolen. When they were half-way\nacross, the stream rose so suddenly that it swept them all away. From\nthat time it became the best fishing stream in the country-side.\n\nThe miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in\ntime grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.\n\nAnd the three sisters, now that they no longer insulted the sun, had\neach a wooer within a week.\n\nWhen the prince got home he found that his wife had just got a fine\nlittle boy. He did not lose a moment in pricking the baby's finger till\nthe blood ran, and he brushed it on the wrists of the stone figure,\nwhich shuddered all over and split with a loud noise in seven parts and\nthere was the faithful servant alive and well.\n\nWhen the old king saw this he foamed with rage, stared wildly about,\nflung himself on the ground and died.\n\nThe servant stayed on with his royal master and served him faithfully\nall the rest of his life; and, if neither of them is dead, he is serving\nhim still.",
    "question": "What moral lessons about obedience, trust, and fortune does the tale of Lucky Luck convey?",
    "answer": "The story teaches that blind disobedience can be dangerous, that wise counsel and faithfulness save lives, and that true 'luck' comes to those who help others, act generously, and heed good advice."
